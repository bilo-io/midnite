# Phase 13 — Repos as a first-class entity

> midnite is pitched as a **multi-repo** orchestrator, but `repos` is still half-wired. `RepoConfig` is just `{ name, path }` ([`config.ts`](../packages/shared/src/config.ts)), `config.repos` defaults to `[]` and is only populated by hand-editing `midnite.json`, and `task.repo` is a **nullable free-text name** ([`task.ts`](../packages/shared/src/task.ts)) with exactly one consumer — [`resolveCwd`](../packages/gateway/src/terminal/terminal.service.ts) maps `task.repo` (name) → `config.repos[].path` to pick the PTY cwd, and **silently falls through** to a fallback dir on a typo or empty list. The new-task UI has no repo picker, and inference never sets it. **Phase 13 promotes `repos` to a managed, DB-backed entity the workflow can actually revolve around** — a registry users CRUD in the app, a picker in task creation, and references that *resolve to a known repo* instead of no-op-ing on a typo.

> **Scope guardrails (CLAUDE.md).** Repos are a new gateway feature module: `controller → service → repository`, Drizzle queries only in the repository, business logic in the service, thin controller validating against zod schemas in [`@midnite/shared`](../packages/shared/src/). The repo wire shapes (entity, create/update requests) live in `shared` — `cli` and `web` stay pure HTTP clients. New table gets a **forward-only** migration; no foreign keys across logical domains (a task references a repo by its registry-unique **name**, not a cross-domain FK). `shared` is the contract.

> **This phase is deliberately tight: Themes A + B only** (the registry + making it selectable/validated). The richer payoffs that *depend* on a real repo entity — inference guessing, per-repo concurrency caps, branch/PR templates, UI surfacing — are scoped as **deferred follow-ons** below, not built here.

> Effort tags: **S** small · **M** medium · **L** large. Themes are ordered A → B (A is the prerequisite). Every box starts unchecked — this is net-new work.

## Current state (baseline to build on)

- **shared:** `RepoConfigSchema = { name, path }` ([`config.ts:5`](../packages/shared/src/config.ts)); `config.repos` defaults to `[]`. `task.repo` is `z.string().optional()` ([`task.ts:58`](../packages/shared/src/task.ts)); `CreateTaskRequestSchema` already accepts an optional `repo`.
- **gateway:** `tasks.repo` is a nullable `text('repo')` column ([`db/schema.ts`](../packages/gateway/src/db/schema.ts)). The **only** consumer is [`resolveCwd`](../packages/gateway/src/terminal/terminal.service.ts) (priority: project workDir → `task.repo`→`config.repos[].path` → profile fallback → `process.cwd()`). A missing/mismatched name silently skips to the fallback. Inference (`classifier.service.ts` / `planner.service.ts`) **never** touches repo.
- **web:** no repo picker in the new-task flow; repo is never surfaced on cards or threads.
- **cli:** `add` has no `--repo` flag.
- **No repo CRUD anywhere** — the list lives only in `midnite.json`.

---

## Theme A — Repo registry (DB-backed) — **M**

Make repos a managed entity users populate and CRUD in the app, not an empty config array.

### A1. `repos` table + repository — **S–M**
- [ ] New Drizzle table `repos` in [`db/schema.ts`](../packages/gateway/src/db/schema.ts): `id` (UUIDv7), `name` (**unique**), `path`, timestamps. Forward-only migration (next in [`packages/gateway/drizzle/`](../packages/gateway/drizzle/)). Carry a nullable `branchPrefix` / `prTemplate` / `cap` column shape only if cheap — otherwise leave them to the deferred themes (don't gold-plate the migration; a later forward migration can add them).
- [ ] `RepoRepository` — Drizzle queries only (`list`, `getById`, `getByName`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`), accepting a `Db` so the service owns transactions.

### A2. `RepoService` + module + REST — **M**
- [ ] `ReposModule` registered in `AppModule`; `RepoService` owns business logic (UUIDv7 generation, **unique-name enforcement** → a typed domain error, path validation/normalisation — expand `~`).
- [ ] Thin `RepoController`: `GET /repos`, `POST /repos`, `PATCH /repos/:id`, `DELETE /repos/:id` — validate bodies via the shared schemas; translate domain errors to HTTP (duplicate name → 409, unknown id → 404).
- [ ] Shared schemas in [`shared/src/repo.ts`](../packages/shared/src/) (new): `RepoSchema`, `CreateRepoRequestSchema`, `UpdateRepoRequestSchema`; barrel export + typed client functions in the shared API client. (`RepoConfigSchema` stays for the config/seed path.)

### A3. Seed from config + source-of-truth handoff — **S**
- [ ] On first boot, **seed** the `repos` table from `config.repos` (insert any config repo whose name isn't already a row). After seeding, the **DB is the runtime source of truth**; `midnite.json` `repos` becomes a one-time seed (+ a safe re-import that upserts by name, never deletes).
- [ ] `resolveCwd` reads the repo path from the **registry** (via `RepoService`/repository), not directly from `config.repos`. (Decision §2.)

### A4. Settings UI — **S–M**
- [ ] A **Settings > Repos** panel (web): list repos (name · path), add / edit / remove, with inline validation (duplicate name, empty path). Follow the existing settings/modal conventions — no new modal primitive.

---

## Theme B — Selectable & validated — **M**

A repo you can choose at task-creation time, and a `task.repo` that always points at a *known* repo.

### B1. Repo picker in task creation — **M**
- [ ] **Web:** a repo picker (select / combobox) in the new-task flow, populated from `GET /repos`, with an explicit **"Unassigned"** choice. Sends the chosen repo on `POST /tasks` (the request already carries `repo`).
- [ ] **CLI:** an `add --repo <name>` flag ([`cli/src/`](../packages/cli/src/)); thin — parse → typed client call. Optionally list valid names on an unknown value.

### B2. Validated references (no silent fall-through) — **M**
- [ ] On task **create/update**, validate `repo` against the registry: an unknown name is **rejected** (clear error) or coerced to explicit "unassigned" — never persisted as a dangling free string. (Decision §3.)
- [ ] [`resolveCwd`](../packages/gateway/src/terminal/terminal.service.ts) now resolves `task.repo` against the registry; because references are validated on write, a stored repo always resolves (or is explicitly unassigned).
- [ ] Reference key stays the repo **name** (registry-unique), not a new `repoId` — avoids a churny migration across `task.repo` consumers. (Decision §1.)

### B3. Define + test cwd precedence — **S**
- [ ] Document and **test** the cwd precedence (kept orthogonal per Decision §4): **project workDir → repo → profile fallback → `process.cwd()`**. Add gateway tests covering: project workDir wins over repo; repo used when no project workDir; explicit-unassigned + no project → fallback. This pins the behaviour that's currently implicit in `resolveCwd`.

## Deferred follow-ons (NOT in this phase)

These all *depend on* a real repo entity (Themes A+B) and are the natural next slices — captured here so the boundary is explicit. They map to [`outstanding.md`](outstanding.md) #5/#8/#9 and Phase 7 Theme C.

- **C · Repo guessing in inference** — the planner gets the repo manifest and picks a target repo per task; persist to `task.repo`. (`outstanding.md` #5.) **S.**
- **D · Per-repo concurrency caps** — the scheduler ([`agent-pool-scheduler.service.ts`](../packages/gateway/src/pool/agent-pool-scheduler.service.ts)) tracks a per-repo in-flight counter + a cap so N agents don't hit the same repo at once. *(Bonus candidate: the tick is currently a pure FIFO that ignores `task.priority` — worth fixing alongside.)* (`outstanding.md` #8.) **M.**
- **E · Per-repo branch naming + PR templates** — extend the repo entity with `branchPrefix`/`prTemplate`; consume in [`build-agent-prompt.ts`](../packages/gateway/src/pool/lib/build-agent-prompt.ts) / `gh pr create`. (`outstanding.md` #9.) **S.**
- **F · Surface repo in UI** — repo chip on task cards/threads; an optional **per-repo status** dashboard widget (in-flight agents / queue depth per repo). (Phase 7 Theme C.) **S.**
- **Repo-on-disk management** — midnite cloning/pulling/worktree-creating repos. Out of scope; the registry assumes the checkout already exists at `path`.

---

## Files this phase touches (map)

- **shared:** new [`shared/src/repo.ts`](../packages/shared/src/) (`RepoSchema` + create/update requests) + barrel + tests; typed client functions for `/repos`. Keep [`config.ts`](../packages/shared/src/config.ts) `RepoConfigSchema` for the seed path.
- **gateway:** new `repos/` module — `repos.controller.ts`, `repos.service.ts`, `repos.repository.ts`, `repos.module.ts` (register in `AppModule`); `repos` table in [`db/schema.ts`](../packages/gateway/src/db/schema.ts) + a forward-only migration under [`drizzle/`](../packages/gateway/drizzle/); seed-on-boot wiring; point [`resolveCwd`](../packages/gateway/src/terminal/terminal.service.ts) + task create/update validation at the registry ([`tasks.service.ts`](../packages/gateway/src/tasks/tasks.service.ts)).
- **web:** a **Settings > Repos** panel; a repo picker in the new-task flow; `getRepos`/`createRepo`/… client calls in [`lib/api.ts`](../packages/web/lib/api.ts).
- **cli:** `add --repo` flag in [`cli/src/`](../packages/cli/src/).
- **Docs:** update [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) (repos are now a DB entity, not just config) + README config docs (`config.repos` is a seed); append to [`done.md`](done.md) as slices land.

---

## Verification

- [ ] `moon run gateway:dev` + `moon run web:dev`: in **Settings > Repos**, add / edit / remove a repo; the list persists across a gateway restart (DB-backed, not config).
- [ ] A fresh DB with `config.repos` populated **seeds** those repos into the registry on first boot; thereafter the DB is authoritative.
- [ ] Creating a task with the repo **picker** persists `task.repo`; the agent's PTY opens in that repo's `path` (when no project workDir overrides it).
- [ ] Creating/updating a task with an **unknown** repo name is rejected (or coerced to unassigned) — never stored as a dangling string; `resolveCwd` no longer silently falls through on a typo.
- [ ] `midnite add "…" --repo <name>` sets the repo; an unknown name errors clearly.
- [ ] cwd precedence (project workDir → repo → fallback → cwd) is covered by gateway tests.
- [ ] `moon run :typecheck` · `moon run :lint` · `moon run :test` green across the graph; `moon ci` green. (Run web tests from the **primary checkout**, not a `.git` worktree.)

## Decisions / open questions

1. **Reference by name vs id** *(recommend: name).* `task.repo` keeps storing the repo **name**; the registry enforces name uniqueness, so a name resolves unambiguously. Avoids a churny `repoId` migration across every `task.repo` consumer. Re-naming a repo is the known cost — handle by updating affected tasks or treating the old name as unassigned.
2. **`config.repos` fate** *(recommend: one-time seed).* DB is the runtime source of truth after first boot; `config.repos` seeds an empty registry and offers a safe upsert-by-name re-import. Don't keep two live sources.
3. **Unknown-repo behaviour** *(recommend: reject on write).* Validate `task.repo` against the registry at create/update; reject unknown names (or coerce to explicit "unassigned"). Predictable beats a dangling string that no-ops at cwd-resolution time.
4. **Project ↔ repo relationship** *(settled in brainstorm: orthogonal).* `project.workDir` and `task.repo` stay separate axes; precedence is **project workDir → repo → fallback → cwd**, now documented and tested (B3). A project *referencing* a repo is a possible future simplification, not this phase.
5. **Migration shape** *(open).* Add only `id`/`name`/`path`/timestamps now, or also stub the deferred `branchPrefix`/`prTemplate`/`cap` columns to save a later migration? **Recommend minimal now** — a forward migration adds them cleanly when Themes D/E land.
